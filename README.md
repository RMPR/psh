# psh
This is a simple shell made for learning purpose.

# Usage

```
psh 
```
Opens a new prompt with a pattern defined in psh.cfg (if the file doesn't exist it will be created with the default pattern `>`). Think of it as a cheap equivalent of `$PS1`.
Now the Shell is working like any other shell, infinite loop waiting for user input starting execution after the user presses `\n`. 
It doesn't support piping and redirecting.
